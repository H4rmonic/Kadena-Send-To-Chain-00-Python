# Kadena-Send-To-Chain-00-Python
A simple (and terribly written/optimized) python script using selenium and chrome that will send the balance of all chains 01-19 to chain 00 for a given Kadena Public/Private Keypair

This script is horribly inneffiecient and takes around 3 hours to complete. 


# Usage: 
Insert your public and private keys on lines 18-21 <br>
> usr=('pubkey') <br>
> pwd=('pubkeyagainforsomereason') <br>
> amount=('0.1')<br>
> signature=('privkey')<br>
Pip install dependencies <br>
Install chromedriver for selenium https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started <br>
????<br>
Profit! <br>
